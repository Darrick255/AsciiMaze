<p>This means that it is incomplete and may be missing the features discussed here. The development is done on my free time after work and school.</p>

<h3>
<a id="what-and-why" class="anchor" href="#what-and-why" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What and Why?</h3>

<p>I have been using Python to do small task and compete in coding challenges, I Decided I would make my own simple game to learn python a bit better and to learn git. I Chose a Maze because it is simple enough but with room for complexity. As of publishing this page the maze contains the following features:</p>

<ul>
<li>Recursively and iterativly generate a maze using backtracking.</li>
<li>Draw The Maze With ASCII characters</li>
<li>Draw the Maze better With different character set. This takes up more space but looks nicer and gives room for items in the maze.</li>
<li>Draw the maze using Turtle graphics. this makes everything look polished.</li>
<li>Solve the maze from an arbitrary point(player) using a* and Manhattan distance heuristic.

<ul>
<li>Draw the path on the maze using &lt;&gt;^V (only works the second maze drawing method above).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="what-to-do-now" class="anchor" href="#what-to-do-now" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What to do now</h3>

<p>I slowly want to expand this into a full functioning enjoyable game. the features that would be needed are:</p>

<ul>
<li>A (very) simple game loop that will control the flow of the game.</li>
<li>Controls for the player

<ul>
<li>WASD to move</li>
<li>H to get a hint of which way to move (will have a limit)</li>
<li>Esc will give a menu of quitting/putting the player on auto pilot and watching the sprint to the finish.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>pickups

<ul>
<li>food: lets you use the hints more often</li>
<li>roll of string: lets you see the tiles you have walked on before.</li>
<li>Glasses: enlarge your view of the maze.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>timer so you can have a top score</li>
<li>Save/load Seed/Game to continue or replay a certain maze.</li>
<li>Unlikely but a multiplayer race would be a fun addition.</li>
</ul>
