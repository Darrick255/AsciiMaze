{"name":"Asciimaze","tagline":"A simple maze game built with python. ","body":"### ASCII Maze is a work in progress\r\nThis means that it is incomplete and may be missing the features discussed here. The development is done on my free time after work and school.\r\n\r\n### What and Why?\r\nI have been using Python to do small task and compete in coding challenges, I Decided I would make my own simple game to learn python a bit better and to learn git. I Chose a Maze because it is simple enough but with room for complexity. As of publishing this page the maze contains the following features:\r\n* Recursively and iterativly generate a maze using backtracking.\r\n* Draw The Maze With ASCII characters\r\n* Draw the Maze better With different character set. This takes up more space but looks nicer and gives room for items in the maze.\r\n* Draw the maze using Turtle graphics. this makes everything look polished.\r\n* Solve the maze from an arbitrary point(player) using a* and Manhattan distance heuristic.\r\n    * Draw the path on the maze using <>^V (only works the second maze drawing method above).\r\n\r\n### What to do now\r\nI slowly want to expand this into a full functioning enjoyable game. the features that would be needed are:\r\n* A (very) simple game loop that will control the flow of the game.\r\n* Controls for the player\r\n    * WASD to move\r\n    * H to get a hint of which way to move (will have a limit)\r\n    * Esc will give a menu of quitting/putting the player on auto pilot and watching the sprint to the finish.\r\n* pickups\r\n    * food: lets you use the hints more often\r\n    * roll of string: lets you see the tiles you have walked on before.\r\n    * Glasses: enlarge your view of the maze.\r\n* timer so you can have a top score\r\n* Save/load Seed/Game to continue or replay a certain maze.\r\n* Unlikely but a multiplayer race would be a fun addition.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
