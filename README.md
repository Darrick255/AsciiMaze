# AsciiMaze
A simple maze game built with python. This was started A few years back as an attempt for me to learn python and git.
I lost focus on git but learned some python.

This program builds a maze and can show it to you in ascii or more recently turtle drawings.
It can solve the maze with A*

Future plans are to make this an actual program. With an interface. not just some code to be put into an interpreter.
I may also include better/more pathfinding scripts
